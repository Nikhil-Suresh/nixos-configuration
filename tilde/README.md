# Home directory scripts and configuration

These files are mostly my own settings and tools, but some may be more generally
useful.

## Install

```shell script
git clone git@gitlab.com:engmark/tilde.git
cd tilde
./install.bash
```

You'll need to remove existing dot files for this to install successfully.
